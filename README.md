# Recommendation_system_python
This project focuses on developing a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization techniques to suggest items (such as movies, books, or products) to users based on their previous preferences and the behavior of similar users. Recommendation engines have become essential components in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify to provide personalized experiences to users.

üß† Objective
The goal of this project is to build a model that can:

Predict user preferences for unrated items.

Generate personalized item recommendations using user-item interaction data.

Evaluate the model using suitable performance metrics like RMSE or Precision@K.

We achieve this using user-based collaborative filtering or matrix factorization (SVD) techniques.

üìÇ Dataset
A user-item interaction dataset is used. Example:

MovieLens (e.g., ratings.csv): contains user IDs, item IDs (movie IDs), and corresponding ratings.

Dataset fields typically include:

user_id

item_id or movie_id

rating

(Optional) timestamp

The dataset is split into:

Training set: to train the model on known ratings.

Test set: to predict unseen user-item interactions.

üõ† Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Programming language used.

Pandas & NumPy: For data loading, manipulation, and matrix operations.

Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, accuracy).

Matplotlib / Seaborn: To visualize performance and recommendations.

Surprise (optional): A specialized library for recommendation systems (not used in this version for better portability).

üß± Approach
‚úÖ Collaborative Filtering
We implement user-user collaborative filtering:

Finds users with similar rating behavior.

Recommends items liked by similar users.

Uses a user-item matrix and cosine similarity to compute closeness between users.

‚úÖ Matrix Factorization (Optional)
Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensionality of the user-item matrix:

Captures latent factors (e.g., genre preferences).

Efficient for sparse data.

‚öôÔ∏è Model Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Load ratings dataset.

Create a user-item matrix (rows = users, columns = items).

Normalize if needed.

Similarity Calculation:

Compute cosine similarity between users.

Identify top-N similar users for a target user.

Rating Prediction:

Predict unknown ratings based on weighted average of similar users' ratings.

Evaluation:

Use Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for rating prediction accuracy.

Optional: Precision@K, Recall@K for top-N recommendation tasks.

Recommendation:

For a given user, recommend top-N items with highest predicted ratings that they haven‚Äôt rated yet.

‚úÖ Output & Results
A trained recommendation model that suggests items to users.

Visual outputs of user similarity, recommendation lists, and evaluation metrics.

(Optional) Interactive recommendation preview via CLI or Streamlit app.
